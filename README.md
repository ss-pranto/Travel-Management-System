# 🌍 Travel Management System

This is a **Travel Management System** built with a focus on clean object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, user-friendly features, and efficient data handling using text files. It’s designed to simulate a real-world travel agency platform where users can explore, manage, and purchase travel packages while admins can oversee the entire system including hotel and transport management.

## 💡 What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Object-oriented design patterns  
- File I/O operations and data persistence  
- Building feature-rich CLI-based systems  
- Separating concerns across user roles (Admin vs. User)  

## 📌 Future Improvements

- GUI or web-based version using Python/HTML/CSS  
- Integration with real-time APIs for flights, hotels, etc.  
- Database support (e.g., SQLite or MySQL)
